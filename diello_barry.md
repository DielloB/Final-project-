This computer science class is my first experience with coding, and I’m finding it very hard.
One of the biggest problems I have is creating files and writing code the right way. Even setting up the programs and tools needed for coding are confusing. There’s so much new
information to learn all at once, and sometimes it feels overwhelming.I often have trouble understanding how everything works together. For example, I might know what I want a program to
do, but myc codes don't work. I also make mistakes that I don’t know how to fix, which can be frustrating. It’s like learning a new language, and I’m struggling with the basics.I think
the rest of the semester will be challenging because there’s still a lot I don’t understand. Coding seems to require a mix of problem-solving,and paying attention to small mathematical
details, and those are things I’ll need to work on. I know it will take time and practice to get better at it.Even though it feels hard right now, I’m going
to keep trying. I know I won’t understand everything right away, but I’m hoping that with effort and help, I’ll improve over time. It might not be easy, but I’m ready to keep learning and
do my best.
